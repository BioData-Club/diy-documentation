# Motivation for documentation

> **For others:** Because you want to *transfer* knowledge.
>
> **For yourself:** Because *future you* would like to know what *past you* was thinking.

From [Write the Docs' "A beginnerâ€™s guide to writing documentation"](http://www.writethedocs.org/guide/writing/beginners-guide-to-docs/):

1. You will be using your (project) in 6 months
1. You want people to use your (project)
1. You want people to help out
1. You want your (project) to be better

We will be using the readthedocs.org platform as a way to easily publish a documentation website.  It focuses on programming and code documentation, but the service can be used for hosting any kind of non-commercial documentation you like for free.
