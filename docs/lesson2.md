# The Magic of Markdown

> Markdown is a light-weight markup language that uses a simple, unobtrusive syntax to add formatting elements, such as headings and italics, to plain text documents.  It can be easily converted to many output formats, most notably HTML.  

## Why is Markdown Magic?
- It makes writing for the web easy and fun!  There are many **free** applications that create website content from markdown files, like Read the Docs!
- Unlike HTML, it's easy to read even when you're looking at a raw file.
- There's a gentle learning curve and lots of [online documentation](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).
- Many use cases:  websites, [documents](https://ulysses.app/), [slides](https://github.com/gnab/remark), [books](https://leanpub.com), and more!

## The Basics
- You can create Markdown files using a text editor.  The file should have an .md or .markdown extension.
- You can also use a dedicated Markdown application, like [HackMD](https://hackmd.io/).

- A **very brief** syntax primer:
  - To create a heading, add number signs (e.g. # My Header) in front of a word or phrase.  For example, use 1 (#) for level 1 headings, Use (##) for level two headings and so on.
  - To bold text use two asterisks before and after a word or phrase.  

  > For example `**bold**` will render as **bold**.

  - For italic use one asterisk before and after a word or phrase.

  > `*italics*` will render as *italics*

  - To create a link, enclose the link text in brackets (e.g., [Follow me on Twitter]) and then follow it immediately with the URL in parentheses (e.g., (https://twitter.com/rchampieux)).  
  
  > So, `[Follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/rchampieux)` will render as [Follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/rchampieux).
