# The Magic of Markdown

> Markdown is a light-weight markup language that uses a simple, unobtrusive syntax to add formatting elements, such as headings and italics, to plain text documents.  It can be easily converted to many output formats, most notably HTML.  

## Why is Markdown magic?
- It makes writing for the web easy and fun!  There are many **free** applications that create website content from markdown files, like Read the Docs!
- Unlike HTML, it's easy to read even when you're looking at a raw file.
- There's a gentle learning curve and lots of online documentation.
- Many use cases:  websites, [documents](https://ulysses.app/), [slides](https://github.com/gnab/remark), [books](https://leanpub.com), and more!

## The Basics
- You can create Markdown files using a text editor.  The file should have an .md or .markdown extension.
- You can also use a dedicated Markdown application, like [HackMD](https://hackmd.io/).
- A **very brief** syntax primer:
  - To create a heading, add number signs (e.g. # My Header) in front of a word or phrase.  Use 1 (#) for heading level 1, Use (##) for heading level two and so on.
  - To bold text use two asterisks before and after a word or phrase.  For example `**bold**` will render as **bold**.
  - For italic use one asterisk before and after a word or phrase.  `*italics*` will render as *italic*
  - To create a link, enclose the link text in brackets (e.g., [Follow me on Twitter]) and then follow it immediately with the URL in parentheses (e.g., (https://twitter.com/rchampieux)).

Create a Markdown file using a text editor or a dedicated Markdown application. The file should have an .md or .markdown extension.
